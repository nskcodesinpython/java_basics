Junit - Testing framework for Java
      - every change all the test cases should be re-executed.

Unit testing - testing small chunks of the code
             - early identification of the defects
             - tend to spend more time on reading the code

Manual Unit testing:
            - test cases are tested manually without any automated tool
            - less reliable and time consuming

Automated Unit Testing:
            - test cases are tested using tools
            - More reliable and faster

package:
    org.junit.Test
